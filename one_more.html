    <h1>One More</h1>
    <p>Sometimes the MBTA isn't the most reliable and you're wondering if you have time to have one more before the next train shows up?</p>
    <p>Note this is still a beta feature.</p>
    <p>The closest station from <span id="barName"></span> is <span id="resolved_mbta_stop"></span>.</p>
    <p>It's about an <span id="mbta_distance"></span> minute walk.</p>
    <p>Here's the next departure times:</p>
    <p><span id="departure_one"></span></p>
    <p><span id ="departure_two"></span></p>
